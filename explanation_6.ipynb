    "# Explanation for Problem 6:  Unsorted Integer Array\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "The time requirement is `O(n)`, and it is prohibited to use Python's inbuilt `min` and `max` functions. A single traversal is preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Design\n",
    "This is such an easy problem, I wonder if I understood it wrong :P\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyways, we have two variables to keep track of the current `min` and `max` in the array, and we update them as we traverse the array one single time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Efficiency\n",
    "The time efficiency is `O(n)`, and we can solve this problem in a single traversal, since we don't have to look at any elements more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Efficiency\n",
    "We don't need extra space, so the space efficiency is `O(1)`."
