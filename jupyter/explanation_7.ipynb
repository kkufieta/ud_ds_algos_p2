    "# Explanation for Problem 7:  Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "There are no space or time complexity requirements for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Design\n",
    "The Router's functionality is to add paths and their respective handlers, as well as retrieve handlers for a given path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying datastructure is a RouteTrie, a trie that stores path segments as keys (as opposed to single characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Efficiency\n",
    "We are assuming that we store `n` paths and their respective handlers, and the \"length\" of a path is `m`. I believe that `n` can be a big number, while `m` should be a relatively small constant number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Efficiency\n",
    "There are three main operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Insert a path & handler\n",
    "2. Look up a handler for a given path\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the assumptions mentioned above, it takes `O(m)` time complexity for both insertion and lookup of a path. That's `O(n*m)` to insert or look up `n` paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Efficiency\n",
    "The trie requires at most `O(n*m)` space."
